## Skills and Technologies:
### Languages
My love of learning new things leads me to trying out a bunch of different languages. Some I like more than others.
Some of my favourites:
- Python (+ Django) - I've also done some Machine Learning in Python
- Javascript (+ React) - React is my Javascript framework of choice
- Java - while I initially despised Java coming from Python, for large projects, it comes in handy
- Haskell - Unfortunately Haskell has (so far) been left at university
- Golang - I've had a small amount of experience, scripting, recently, but I have good vibes so far
- HTML - ðŸ˜‰

These are okay:
- C - Pros: A lot of control. Cons: A lot to control.
- Prolog - Pretty fun and perfect for a very specific set of problems.

Some of my not so favourites:
- PHP - Why is it so hard to be productive?
- React Native - One code base, two OSs = Yay. One code base, one out of date dependency = Everything breaks and four hours of debugging because you first have to debug why the debugger isn't working

### APIs
- REST - Who hasn't used REST / JSON over HTTP?
- gRPC - Microservices future? Binary over HTTP2 = super fast
- GraphQL - Still JSON over HTTP, but getting required data on the frontend is just that little bit easier (in my opinion anyway)


### Infrastructure + CI/CD
Some technologies aren't languages, I won't discriminate this time.
- Docker 
  - Before learning Docker: "Docker seems useless."
  - After learning docker: "Why isn't this containerised?"
- Kubernetes - For when your containers can't organise themselves
- AWS - DVA and soon (hopefully) SAA, AWS is a powerful platform
- Jenkins - Pipelines can hasten development cycles
- Heroku - Super easy deployments
- Netlify - Great for static, server side generated, static sites, such as those that use Gatsby.js

### Other
- Osquery - SQL to gather operating system info? Pretty cool.
